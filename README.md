# Overview of the project
## Project : Automaric File Sorter using Python.<br/>

This program sorts the files present in a directory and moves them in their respective folders created by the program itself.<br/>
The aim of this project was to create a program that makes the file sorting and managing process easier.<br/>
This program works by reading the files names and its extensions.<br/>
After reading the extensions, the program automaticall creates foldes based on the extensions. For example - A folder named .pdf.<br/>
After the folders are created the files are automatically moved to the respective folders based on the file extensions.<br/>

### Key Activities

- **File Sorting:** Catagorizies the files based on the extensions of the files.<br/>

- **File Management:** Files are automatically moved to the respective folders making file managing easier.<br/>

### Technologies Used

- **Python:** Primary programming language used for data analysis.<br/>
- **OS:** Python has a built-in os module with methods for interacting with the operating system, like creating files and directories, management of files and directories, input, output, environment variables, process management, etc.<br/>
- **Shutil:** The shutil module offers a number of high-level operations on files and collections of files. In particular, functions are provided which support file copying and removal.<br/>
- **Tkinter:** Python has a built-in os module with methods for interacting with the operating system, like creating files and directories, management of files and directories, input, output, environment variables, process management, etc.<br/>
